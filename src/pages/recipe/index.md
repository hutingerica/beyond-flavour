title: Recipe 💭
subtitle: "Dumplings inspired me to experiment with seasonal and local ingredients. It brings me an opportunity to try creative combinations of dough skins, fillings, ways of preparing and sauces spontaneously. I hope my site can be a place to co-create ideas of zero-waste cooking with anyone and bring our environment a better chance to carry on. Please enjoy a craft rhythm of cooking. 🎶 Take a simple ingredient and turn it in gold. There is no definition of "perfection" and “gold”. Let's think outside the box 💭! Explore ingredients around local groceries and play with the imagination of zero-waste home cooking."
