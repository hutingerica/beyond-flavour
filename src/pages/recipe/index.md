subtitle: "I was inspired by dumplings to experiment with seasonal and local ingredients. It brings me an opportunity to try creative combinations of <mark> dough skins </mark> , fillings, ways of preparing and sauces spontaneously. Please enjoy a craft rhythm of cooking. Take a simple ingredient that is going out of date and turn it in gold. Let's think outside the box and explore ingredients around local groceries to play with the imagination of zero-waste home cooking."
