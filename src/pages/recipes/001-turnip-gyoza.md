title: 001 Turnip Gyoza
subtitle: Juicy on the inside, crispy and golden brown on the outside, these pan-fried
  dumplings, Gyoza, are popular weeknight meal as well as a great appetizer for your
  next dinner party. The key characteristic of gyoza (日式煎餃) lies in its cooking method,
  which involves both pan-frying and steaming. They are first fried in a hot pan until
  crispy brown on the bottom sides, then a small amount of water is added before the
  pan is covered to quickly steam the entire dumplings. This technique gives gyoza
  the best mix of textures, where you get crispy bottoms and tender soft tops that
  encase the juicy filling inside.

##### `📝 : Notes`

Sprinkle salt on chopped turnip and leave it for `10 mins` to squeeze the water out. I  didn't put many seasonings because there's already a great combination of flavour from kimchi and canned tuna.

###### `👀 : 3rd Step` Pan Fry

`〰️` Heat oil in a frying pan over medium high heat.<br>

`〰️` Place gyozas when the pan is hot.<br>

`〰️` Cook until the bottom of the gyoza turns golden brown.<br>

`〰️` Add `1/4 cup` of water to the pan and immediately cover with a lid for steaming around `2 mins` or until most of the water evaporates.<br>

`〰️` Remove the lid and pour the `corn flour water` around the corners of gyozas to make crispy texture. Cook uncovered until the gyoza is nice and crisp on the bottom.

  ##### `📝 : Notes`

To make Corn flour water : `1tbsp` corn flour and `1/3 cup ` water.<br>
Because the filling is already cooked, it's no need to steam too long. Adding a little bit of oil around the pan is easier to transfer gyozas to the plate.

###### `🔥 : Spicy` `🍋 : Sour` Soy Dipping Sauce

`1` Soy Sauce<br>

`1` White Vinegar (Any kind of vinegar)<br>

`0.5` Chili Oil<br>

##### `📝 : Notes`

There's already a spicy flavour from kimchi, so the sauce here is a version of less chili oil.
