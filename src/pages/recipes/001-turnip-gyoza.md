title: 001 Turnip Gyoza
subtitle: Juicy on the inside, crispy and golden brown on the outside, these pan-fried
  dumplings, Gyoza, are popular weeknight meal as well as a great appetizer for your
  next dinner party. The key characteristic of gyoza (日式煎餃) lies in its cooking method,
  which involves both pan-frying and steaming. They are first fried in a hot pan until
  crispy brown on the bottom sides, then a small amount of water is added before the
  pan is covered to quickly steam the entire dumplings. This technique gives gyoza
  the best mix of textures, where you get crispy bottoms and tender soft tops that
  encase the juicy filling inside.
