 Hi, I'm Erica. I’m a designer at Bristol who really loves foods and cooking. My <mark>& Beyond Flavour</mark> was initially born with a sense of curiosity about the science behind cooking. 
 I love cooking for people I love and can't stop immersing myself in creating a-ha cuisines which slowly became a dream to share recipes that showed how delightful cooking can be.

# What am I going to do

<mark>**Create 100 ways of making dumplings**</mark>

As an avid foodie growing up in Tainan, a city in Taiwan with plenty heritage of Taiwanese street foods, I started my nostalgic journey at Bristol to make them into my own. One of my favourite and classical dish - Dumplings inspired me to experiment with seasonal and local ingredients. It brings me an opportunity to try creative combinations of dough skins, fillings, ways of preparing and sauces spontaneously. My hope with this site is to explore a-ha dumpling recipes that show how creative dumplings can be.

<mark>**Share recipes led zero-waste challenge**</mark>

My challenge to zero-food-waste was began when I moved to Bristol. Inspired by the communities here taking action and contributing to a more sustainable food system, I started to play with leftover or unused part of ingredients that showed how possible dumplings can be as a hero of eliminating waste. In addition, it is easy to freeze and thus preserve them, so I hope my site can be a place to co-create ideas of zero-waste cooking with anyone who care the issue and bring our environment and the places we love and live a better chance to carry on.

## My Philosophy

#### **Talk Less & Feel More**
<mark>Enjoy a craft rhythm of dumpling making.</mark>
Take a simple ingredient and turn it in gold. There is no definition of "perfection" and “gold”. It is a sensual creation of what it means to be yourself.

#### **Waste Less, Play More**
<mark>Create cuisines unique to your own and the place you live.</mark>
Get out of a cooking rut. Explore ingredients around local groceries and play with the imagination of zero-waste home cooking.
